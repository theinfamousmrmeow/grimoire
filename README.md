# grimoire
A collection of helpful scripts and macros designed to be used a Submodule in GameMaker projects for easy updates.

# How to Use this in a GameMaker Project
- Add a script to your project like `scr_grimoire`
- Navigate to the file location of this new asset and script.
- Initialize this git submodule at this location.
- It will override your `scr_grimoire` with this and from that point can be updated automatically as the Grimoire expands.



# How to remove
 git submodule deinit --all -f
